As a browser user
So that I can choose a link
I would like to see list of links in one page

As a browser user
So that I can save a link
I would like to add a link to the list

As a browser user
So that I can organise links
I would like to add tags to links

As a browser user
So that I can search for related links
I would like to filter a search by a tag


Draw a rough model of the domain

links <=> list <=> database/tags/urls
